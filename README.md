# picarro_d13CO2

The picarro_d13CO2 package includes two MATLAB scripts to compute Keeling intercepts and respiration rates from soil core measurements using a Picarro G2101-i CRDS. The package also includes examples of raw Picarro files (.dat) used as input data for the code. 

The package is related to a publication submitted (xx/05/2019) to Global Change Biology: Wynn, J.G., Duvert, C., Bird, M.I., Munksgaard, N.C., Setterfield, S.A., Hutley, L.B. (2019). Land transformation in tropical savannas preferentially decomposes newly added biomass, whether C3 or C4-derived.
